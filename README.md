# Python3_local_host_active-port_listener

Python 3 script that will print the ports that are active (i.e., listening for incoming connections) on your machine.
This script will scan all ports from 1 to 65535, which is the full range of ports that are available on a computer. It will print out the port number for any port that is active (i.e., listening for incoming connections).
Keep in mind that this script will only scan the ports on the local machine (i.e., the machine that the script is running on). If you want to scan the ports on a different machine, you will need to replace "localhost" with the IP address or hostname of the target machine.
